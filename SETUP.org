For learning resources and help with installation, refer to the
[[http://exercism.org/languages/clojure][Exercism help page]].

To run the tests provided, you will need to install [[http://leiningen.org][Leiningen]].

To install Leiningen on Mac OS X using [[http://brew.sh][Homebrew]], run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew install leiningen
#+END_SRC

For help installing on Linux, Windows or without Homebrew see:
[[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation][Leiningen installation]].

In an exercise directory, create a =src= directory and a file therein to hold
your solution. The name of the file should be the exercise name with dashes =-=
replaced by underscores =_=.  For example, if the exercise is called
=hello-world=, name the solution file =hello_world.clj=.

Your resulting file tree should look something like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/path/to/hello-world

├── project.clj
├── src
│   └── hello_world.clj
└── test
    └── hello_world_test.clj
#+END_EXAMPLE


To run the tests, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following
command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ lein test
#+END_SRC
